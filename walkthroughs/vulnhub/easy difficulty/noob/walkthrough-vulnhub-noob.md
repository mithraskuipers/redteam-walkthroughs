When booting the target virtual machine, you are prompted to provide credentials.
Let's try them out.

![My Image](imgs/1.png)

It does not work.

The target machine also runs an http service.
Let's inspect the page via the attacker machine.

I have no idea what is meant by this.

However, when I would inspect funny.jpg and funny.bmp, I would find the image below...which is not funny at all. And I think this is a hint there is something going on with these images.

Inspect the contents of the images

Steghide


sudo apt update ;
sudo apt install -y steghide ;

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Downloads/downloads]
â””â”€$ steghide extract -sf funny.jpg
Enter passphrase:

â””â”€$ cat hint.py

well, try_ to rotate some words too.
```

I could not extract the contents of funny.bmp using steghide since I do not know the password.

I got stuck here for some time, until I remembered we had this weird "sudo" file that had a weird message inside it: `Did you notice the file name? Isn't is interesting?`. Could `sudo` be the password? It indeed is.

It provided me the following file:

```
â””â”€$ cat user.txt 
jgs:guvf bar vf n fvzcyr bar
```

This seems encoded. Perhaps by some simple alphabet shifting cipher.

I went to the following site to examine my encoded string.

https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier

![My Image](walkthroughs/vulnhub/easy%20difficulty/noob/imgs/7.png)

As you see, the site suggests that I take a look into the ROT-13 Cipher.

By clicking on the suggested cipher, it redirected me to a ROT-13 decrypt tool on the same site.

https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher

![My Image](imgs/8.png)

The string was indeed encoded using the ROT-13 cipher and it hid the text: 
`wtf:this one is a simple one`.

This string does not make a lot of sense.
But the formatting of it gives a hint what it could be related to.
Typically credentials are written as `username:password`.
Could it be, this string contains a username (`wtf`) and password `this one is a simple one`? And for what service?

Maybe it has to do with this ssh service on port `55077`

```
ssh wtf@192.168.97.128 -p 55077
```

```
â””â”€$ ssh wtf@192.168.97.128 -p 55077
